## [A History and Evaluation of System R](A_History_and_Evaluation_of_System_R.pdf) ##
**Summary.**
System R, developed between 1974 and 1979, was one of the first relational
database systems. It was implemented in three phases: phase 0, 1, and 2. Phase
0 was a throw-away single-user database prototype that was used to polish the
SQL interface. Phase 0 surfaced various problems that were solved in Phase 1:
the full featured multi-user database. Phase 2 was a two year period during
which System R was deployed to a number of real-world customers to assess the
system. System R included

- locking based concurrency control,
- a dynamic programming based query optimizer,
- catalogs represented as relations,
- views and authorization,
- embeddings in PL/I and Cobol,
- B-tree based indexes,
- nested loop joins, index loop joins, and sort merge joins,
- crash recovery,
- query compilation, and
- various tweaks and refinements to SQL.

**Commentary.**
System R introduced a bevy of influential and perennial ideas in the field of
databases. Unix introduced a bevy of influential and perennial ideas in the
field of operating systems. It's no coincidence that there are a striking
number of system design principles that System R and Unix---as presented in
*The Unix Time-Sharing System*---share:

1. *Unified Abstractions.* Unix unified the file and I/O device abstraction
   into a single interface. System R unified the table and catalog/metadata API
   into a single interface (i.e. everything is a relation). System R also
   unifed SQL as the query language used for ad-hoc queries, program-embeded
   queries, and view definitions. System R's decision to use relations to
   represent the catalog can also be seen as a form of dogfooding.
2. *Simple is Better.* Unix started as Ken Thompson's pet project as an effort
   to make development simpler and more enjoyable. Unix's simplicity stuck and
   was one of its selling points. Similarly, System R spent a considerable
   amount of effort simplifying the SQL interface to make it as easy to use as
   possible. If a system's interface is too complicated, nobody will use it.
3. *Performance isn't Everything.* Thompson and Ritchie implemented Unix in C
   instead of assembly despite the fact that the kernel size increased by one
   third because C greatly improved the readability and maintainability of the
   system. Similarly, the System R paper comments that the relational model may
   never exceed the performance of a hand-optimized navigational database, but
   the abstraction it provides is worth the cost. Somewhat comically, today's
   compilers and query optimizers are so good, compiled C is likely smaller
   than hand-written assembly and optimized queries are likely faster than
   hand-optimized ones. This is an example of another systems principle of
   favoring higher-level declarative APIs which leave room for optimization.
